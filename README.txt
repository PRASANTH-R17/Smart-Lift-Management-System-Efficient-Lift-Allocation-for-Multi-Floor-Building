Working and Conditions:

In this program, there are a total of four floors, numbered 0 to 3, and three lifts available. Each lift takes approximately 5 seconds to reach the nearest floor.

The program assigns the nearest lift to the person in need and returns which lift was assigned, along with the amount of time it took to become active. However, if all the lifts are already in use, the program returns the message 'All lifts are busy. Please wait for some time.'

Inspiration:

My recent experience during my internship at Valeo. One of the things that caught my attention was the efficient operation of their lifts in a 3-lift and 4-floor building. The lifts worked simultaneously, and the nearest lift would respond to a button press on any floor, ensuring quick and smooth transportation.

This experience inspired me to develop a similar program using the Java programming language, which I am proud to say I have successfully achieved.
